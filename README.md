# Wordle clone
 [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) is a web-based word game, and
 this is how I implemented it with  plain **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**.

### Game rules
The game is very simple you have to guess a five-letter secret word.
You have six tries, after each guess the color of the tiles will change and give you a hint.

##### Color meaning
- **green**: Your letter is in the correct place.
- **yellow**: Your letter is in the secret word, but in the wrong spot.
- **gray**: Your letter is not in the secret word.

### How to play

- You can use your keyboard directly to type in your guess.
- You submit your answer simply by pressing **`enter`** and the color of the tiles will change.
- That's pretty much it.
